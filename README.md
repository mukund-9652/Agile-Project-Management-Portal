# Purpose of this document

The software requirement document plays a crucial role in capturing the requirements for the development of the "Agile Project Management Tool." It serves as a comprehensive guide, systematically documenting both functional and non-functional requirements. 

The document outlines the scope of the project, considering user needs, quality standards, and non-functional aspects. It provides clear guidelines and specifications for the development team to understand the project objectives and constraints. Additionally, the document highlights high-level design considerations, ensuring that the implementation aligns with the project requirements.

 While it does not delve into detailed design aspects, it emphasizes the importance of adhering to the specified design considerations during the implementation phase. Overall, the software requirement document acts as a foundation for scoping the project, guiding the development process, and ensuring the successful delivery of the "Agile Project Management Tool."

# Development Phase

•	The application will be developed in 2 phase. 
•	Each phase will have 4 stages followed by a review at the end. 
•	The phase-1 output will be unit tested core business logic of the application. 
•	In phase-2 the output will be a functional application with micro-service and the font-end.
•	Each stage of the development phase must be completed alongside the learning milestone
